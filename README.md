ENG1P13 Project 4

This is a custom pen plotter based of of DIY-Machines design on thingiverse. This design was a end of year engineering project that I completed in a group of 4 where the challenge was to help a person with disiblities in their life. We chose to help the person be able to paint again. This design uses a custsom ergonomic joystick and 2 arcade style butons as inputs.
